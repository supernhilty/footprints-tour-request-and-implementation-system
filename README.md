## Introduction
The Tour Management System is a B2C software developed in collaboration with the **Tour Operations Department** of **Công đoàn – Báo Người Lao Động**. This system is designed to streamline the management of tour requests and operations, serving both customers and staff.

### Key Features:
- **Customer-Centric Tour Requests**: Customers submit specific tour requests, including departure points, destinations, travel dates, and additional requirements such as team-building activities, gala events, and hotel preferences.
- **Tailored Tour Suggestions**: A suggestion algorithm generates tailored tour options based on customer preferences.
- **Efficient Staff Management**: Staff can customise, adjust, and finalise tour designs, ensuring seamless communication with customers.
- **Tour Execution Support**: Tour guides access itineraries and assigned tours via a mobile app. The app allows guides to:
  - View tour details
  - Send SMS updates to customers
  - Manage participant check-ins

The system enhances planning efficiency and ensures that tours are fully customised to meet customer needs.

## Acknowledgements
We, the team of the Graduation Project - Tour Request and Implementation System, would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has accompanied and supported us throughout this project journey.

First and foremost, we sincerely thank the lecturers in the Software Engineering program, as well as all the esteemed faculty members of the university, who have devotedly guided us over the past years. Your guidance through each assignment, lab, and project, from small to large, has helped us grow, gain confidence, and accumulate invaluable knowledge and skills. This is a precious asset for us as we step into the real world.

We would especially like to express our sincere gratitude to Mr. Kieu Trong Khanh, who has wholeheartedly and diligently guided, provided feedback, and closely followed our progress throughout the project. His insights and lessons have not only helped us complete the project but also instilled in us a professional working style, meticulousness, and a strong sense of responsibility in our work.

Our deepest thanks also go to the businesses that have collaborated with us by providing software requirements, supporting us, and offering important practical information. This has helped us gain a clearer understanding of the requirements and actual processes in the tourism industry.

In addition, we would like to express our gratitude to the university for creating a conducive environment for us to study and conduct research, from facilities to reference materials and training programs.

We cannot fail to mention our families, friends, and seniors – those who have always encouraged, supported, and helped us during difficult times. Their motivation has been a great source of inspiration for us to remain steadfast, overcome challenges, and complete this project.
